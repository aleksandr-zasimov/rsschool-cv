**I'm Mineral Processing Engineer with 12+ years of experience in mining industry.
I became interested in IT because I like to create something new and see the result of my work. At the moment I am also studying as a "Web developer" at SkyPro University.**

**After graduation, I see myself as an enthusiastic and detail-oriented Frontend Software Engineer seeking an entry-level position with Company to use my skills in coding, troubleshooting complex problems, and assisting in the timely completion of projects.**

**In my opinion, becoming a frontend developer is an excellent career move. It's a job you can teach yourself online, the potential salary is high, and there'll be demand for your abilities for years to come.**
